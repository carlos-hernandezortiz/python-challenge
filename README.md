# python-challenge
Third homework for Data Analytics Bootcamp.
The mandatory tasks for this homework were PyPoll and PyBank. In both folders you will find the main.py which contains the code that produces the output. Then, we have the Resources folder which contains the data processed in the main.py and, finally, the analysis (output) folder which contains the result (in txt or csv) of the main.py.
Next, in the optional exercises, PyBoss and PyParagraph, you can also find a main.py, Resources folder and Output folder which contains the file generated when running the code. 
You should take into consideration to adjust the path for the file (according to you computers configuration)
Finally, for PyParagraph, I made the code to run for both the Text files so be sure to take that into consideration and just modify the files path. The program generates two output files and could be extendable for mor.
